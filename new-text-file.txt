New text file 

Making a change to new text file in main branch. 
Then I will have to merge changes with my new branch. 

In the same file in the new branch, I will make and commit changes to create a conflict between branches.

When trying to create a pull request, a conflict will be created. These can then be resolved on GitHub.com.
