# Step 1. Save the file into the local repo (save R script into the GitHub-tutorial folder on my computer)

# Step 2. We have committed the first change 
# Now I am adding some more text so we can commit another change 
# After saving the file, the changes will appear in a tab in the desktop app. You can then commit these changes. After committing, you can revert or discard changes. This should revert changes in the file itself as well. 

# If file is too big to commit and an error appears, *DO NOT CLICK COMMIT ANYWAY*
